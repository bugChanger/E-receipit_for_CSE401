                     E-receipt is an electronic receipt of any goods / services that have been purchased, opposed to a paper receipt. They are usually sent via email to avoid wasting paper and for marketing purposes. Merchants can issue E-receipts using own mechanisms or use external services specialized on electronic payments. It is “Go Green” based software. We are trying to make the carbon footprint lesser. By this software we will reduce the paper need and waste of paper. Beside that every single purchase and cash flow will be at one place. That will help you to know your cost estimation (how much money they are spending) at any place.
